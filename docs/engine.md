# The engine (M1)

How OpenLabel decides which label shows on which product. Everything below the admin and the storefront:
schema, rule conditions, the indexer, variables, the resolver and the CLI. Written during milestone M1; the
admin (M2), Hyvä rendering (M3) and GraphQL / import (M4) build on it.

## Data model

| Table | Holds |
|---|---|
| `openlabel_label` | the *when and where*: name, status, priority (0 = highest), store views, customer groups, `valid_from` / `valid_to` (UTC), the serialized condition tree, the default design, `apply_to_parent`, `hide_lower_priority` |
| `openlabel_design` | the *how it looks*: type (text, image, shape), colours, size, rotation, custom CSS, `is_system` |
| `openlabel_design_store` | text, alt text and tooltip per store view (store 0 = default, other stores fall back to it) |
| `openlabel_placement` | one *where* per label: area (`listing`, `product`), position (`tl … br`), optional design override, offsets, `max_labels`, stacking, gap |
| `openlabel_index` | the result: (`label_id`, `product_id`, `store_id`, `customer_group_id`) with the label's priority and window copied in; `customer_group_id = -1` means every group |

Repositories: `LabelRepositoryInterface` saves a label with its placements, `DesignRepositoryInterface` saves a
design with its store texts. Both validate and answer with actionable messages. A design that labels still
use cannot be deleted. Everything in `Api/` follows semantic versioning from 1.0.

## Conditions

A label's conditions are a core `Magento\Rule` tree (ALL / ANY, nested) stored as JSON in
`conditions_serialized`. Leaves are either the native product-attribute condition (every attribute,
category, SKU, attribute set; store-scoped attributes are evaluated per store view) or one of the built-ins:

| Built-in | Attributes | Source |
|---|---|---|
| On sale | `on_sale` (yes/no), `discount_percent` (rounded half up), `discount_amount` | price index of the store's website and the customer group, so special prices and catalog price rules both count |
| Is new | `news_dates` (inside *Set Product as New* dates, default scope), `days_since_created`, `days_since_updated` | product entity |
| Stock | `is_salable` (yes/no), `salable_qty` | MSI stock of the website's sales channel, legacy stock status without MSI; quantity applies to simple, virtual and downloadable products only |
| Price range | `final_price`, `price` | price index |
| Rating | `rating` (stars) | review summary of the store view |
| Review count | `review_count` | review summary of the store view |

Matching happens in SQL: the tree is attached to a product collection with the core
`Magento\Rule\Model\Condition\Sql\Builder`; built-ins contribute joins and expressions. PHP `validate()` exists
on every condition for previews and tests. Custom conditions: extend
`Iranimij\OpenLabel\Model\Condition\AbstractBuiltIn` and register the class in the
`Iranimij\OpenLabel\Model\Condition\ConditionPool` `types` argument.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- Price-based conditions read the price index, which omits out-of-stock products unless
  *Display Out of Stock Products* is on. Such products cannot get price labels, matching what the storefront lists.
- Disabled products never match. Children of configurable, grouped and bundle products do, which is what
  `apply_to_parent` builds on.

## Indexer

`openlabel_product` (Index Management › *OpenLabel Products*) depends on the price and stock indexers.

- **Full reindex** builds into `openlabel_index_replica`, computes the products that gained or lost a label,
  swaps the tables atomically and cleans the full page cache for exactly those products. A lock prevents
  two full reindexes from overlapping.
- **Partial reindex** (Update on Save, or the changelog in Update by Schedule) rebuilds the rows of the
  changed products plus their configurable / grouped / bundle parents and siblings.
- **Per label**: saving a label rebuilds its rows at once, whatever the indexer mode, and cleans the cache
  for the diff plus the `openlabel_<id>` tag. Deleting a label drops its rows. `openlabel:reindex <id>` and
  the daily cron do the same.
- **Rows**: one per store view the label is limited to (all active store views otherwise). One row per
  allowed customer group when the label is limited to groups or uses a price condition, otherwise one row with
  `customer_group_id = -1`. With `apply_to_parent`, a parent gets a row when any child matches; the row
  remembers the lowest matching child in `parent_product_id`.
- **Triggers**: mview subscriptions on the product, category, website, relation, stock item and review
  summary tables; plugins on the price indexer (`Rows`, `Full`), the stock indexer and review aggregation
  so price, stock and review changes arrive even though index tables are never subscribed (that would flood
  the changelog). A full price or stock reindex invalidates the OpenLabel index.
- **Time**: `valid_from` / `valid_to` are copied into the index and filtered at resolve time, so no cron
  activates labels. Two small crons remain: hourly, clean the cache of labels whose window opened or closed
  during the last hour (a label can therefore appear up to one hour late on cached pages); daily, rebuild
  labels whose conditions depend on the date ("is new", days since created).
- **Known 1.0 limitation**: on multi-source MSI shops, source-item changes that bypass the legacy stock
  item reach the index on the next product save, stock indexer run or full reindex.

## Variables

Label text may contain variables, substituted at render time from the already loaded product (no extra
queries for prices and stock):

`{SAVE_PERCENT}` `{SAVE_AMOUNT}` `{PRICE}` `{SPECIAL_PRICE}` `{FINAL_PRICE}` `{STOCK_QTY}` `{NEW_FOR}` `{SKU}`
`{ATTR:code}` `{BR}` `{SPECIAL_ENDS_IN}` `{SPECIAL_END_DATE}` `{RATING}` `{REVIEW_COUNT}` `{SOLD_LAST_30D}`

Numbers, currency amounts and dates are formatted for the store's locale. Values are escaped; the text itself
may use `b strong i em br span small sup sub` (attributes other than `class`, `id`, `title`, `style` are
removed). Unknown variables stay literal so typos are visible. A zero number renders as "0" and is reported as
empty, which the 1.1 "hide label when a variable is zero/empty" flag will use. `{RATING}`, `{REVIEW_COUNT}` and
`{SOLD_LAST_30D}` load their data once per listing through `VariablePreloadInterface`; `{SPECIAL_ENDS_IN}`
treats `special_to_date` as valid through that day. Custom variables implement
`Iranimij\OpenLabel\Api\VariableProcessorInterface` and are registered in the
`Iranimij\OpenLabel\Model\Variable\Pool` `processors` argument.

## Resolver

`Iranimij\OpenLabel\Api\LabelResolverInterface::getForProducts(int[] $productIds, int $storeId, int $customerGroupId)`
runs **one SELECT** over the index joined with labels, placements, designs and store texts, filtered by status,
UTC time window and `customer_group_id IN (-1, group)`, then arranges the rows: priority order, `hide_lower_priority`
(a matching label with the flag suppresses labels with a higher priority number on that product), and the
per-stack limit (a stack is one area + position; its limit is the `max_labels` of its highest-priority label).

Templates use `Iranimij\OpenLabel\ViewModel\Labels`: call `getForProducts()` once with every product id of the
page, then `getStacks($productId, 'listing')` per item. Results are memoized per request; the customer group
comes from the HTTP context, which the full page cache already varies on. When `openlabel/general/enabled`
is off for the store, the view model returns nothing without a query.

Budget, enforced by integration tests with a query counter: a listing of 36 products costs one query, a
product page costs one query.

## CLI

```
bin/magento openlabel:reindex            # full rebuild through the indexer (lock, swap, cache diff)
bin/magento openlabel:reindex 3          # one label, prints the diff
bin/magento openlabel:preview 3 --store=1 # matched count and the first 20 SKUs from the index
```
