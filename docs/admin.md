# Admin

Milestone M2. Everything lives under **Catalog › OpenLabel**: **Labels** (when and where) and **Designs** (how it looks). Designs are reusable: make one "red pill" and use it in many labels.

## First label in one click

While there are no labels, the Labels grid shows three starters. Each creates an enabled label with a built-in design, applies it to configurable, grouped and bundle parents, and places it on the category listing and the product page:

| Starter | Shows on | Position |
|---|---|---|
| Sale -{SAVE_PERCENT}% | every discounted product | top start |
| New (30 days) | products created in the last 30 days | top end |
| Only {STOCK_QTY} left | products with 5 or fewer pieces left (salable quantity) | bottom start |

The positions were checked free of collisions on the Hyvä 1.4 product card. A second click within a minute does not create a duplicate. The starter's message tells you how many products match.

## Labels grid

Columns: status, name, design preview, where it shows ("Listing TR, Product TL"), matched products (distinct products in the index), active now (with the schedule in the shop timezone), from/to, priority and store views. Filter by name, status, store view or "active now". Click a row to edit name, status, priority or dates inline; mass actions enable, disable or delete. Every change reindexes the label and cleans the cached pages it affects.

## Label form

| Section | What it does |
|---|---|
| Basics | Name (admin only), switch it on or off, pick a design from thumbnails (or create one in a new tab and press "Refresh designs"), priority (lower number wins), "hide other labels", "show on configurable, grouped and bundle products". |
| Show when | Switches for the common cases — On sale (minimum discount %), New (days), Low stock (pieces left), Out of stock, Well rated (stars) — and the advanced rule tree for anything else (any product attribute, category, SKU, attribute set, type). A product must match the switches **and** the tree. Nothing switched on means every product. |
| Show where | One row per placement: page (category/search/widgets or product page), position with the 3×3 picker (arrow keys work), a different design for this page, max labels in that corner, stacking, gap, offsets and "keep left/right in RTL". |
| Who and when | Store views ("All Store Views" = everywhere), customer groups (empty = everyone), start and end in the shop timezone. A date without a time ends at the end of that day. Stored in UTC. |
| Matched products | After the first save: how many products match in the default store view, the first 50 with thumbnails, what to check when nothing matches, and **Reindex now**. |

The **live preview** panel (bottom right, can be hidden) renders the chosen design on a sample product with the same structural CSS as the shop: every placement of the selected page, variables filled with sample values ({SAVE_PERCENT} → 25), desktop and mobile widths, a warning when text contrast is below 4.5:1, and "Preview as" a customer group.

Save, Save & Continue and Save & Duplicate (creates a disabled copy). Problems are listed above the form without a page reload, each saying what to do, for example "Pick at least one placement so the label appears somewhere."

## Designs

Choose **Text**, **Image** or **Shape**; the form shows only what that type needs.

- **Text and shape:** label text with a variable picker and a 24-character counter, colours with a live contrast badge (green ≥ 4.5:1, amber ≥ 3:1, red below), border, shape (rectangle, pill, circle, ribbon, corner) and rotation presets.
- **Image:** PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP or SVG up to 1 MB (a warning above 50 KB). The real content type is checked; SVGs are cleaned (no scripts, event handlers, external references or entities). Width and height are stored so images never shift the layout. Alternative text is required.
- **Size:** percent of the product image width (default) or pixels.
- **Text per store view:** each store view uses the default text unless you untick "Use the default text".
- **Custom CSS:** only for users with the "Edit custom CSS of designs" permission; imports, expressions, script URLs and escapes are removed before it is saved.

The 15 built-in designs are locked: open one and press **Duplicate to edit**. They pass WCAG AA contrast. Designs used by labels and built-in designs cannot be deleted.
